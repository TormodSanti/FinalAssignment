                    <h2>Political Consequences of the Internet</h2>
                    <p>The Internet has become ubiquitous in global communications, commerce, and industry, and as
                        such it has had widespread political effects. These range from the positive (increased access to
                        educational resources, connecting people across continents, and facilitating commerce) to the
                        negative (social alienation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_security_hacking_incidents#1990s" title=" List of security hacking incidents (#1990s and forward). Wikipedia.org">hacking</a>, 
                        and widespread time-wasting) to the downright horrifying

                    <p>In a recent report by the Oxford Internet Institute, it was found that the number of countries with
                    active political disinformation campaigns had increased to 70 in 2019, nearly twice that of
                    2017. This, coupled with widespread usage of censorship and surveillance in many countries,
                    is a threat to democracy across the world, and a way for autocratic societies to consolidate their
                    power. </p>

                    <p>Some of the countries found by Oxford to run these campaigns (either permanently or
                    temporarily during elections), include the US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Poland, Italy,
                    Russia, China, India, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Egypt, and Ethiopia. These 15 countries
                    have a combined population of around 4.5 billion people, meaning that well over half the human
                    population are being subjected to political disinformation by their governments through the
                    internet.</p>
