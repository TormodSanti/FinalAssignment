                        We went a little bit back and fourth during development on how our overall colour scheme for the site should be, with the focus being <em>legibility</em>. 
                        We wanted strong contrasts between text and background, accompanied with a simple sans-serif typeface (such as Arial). 
                        We tried some classic dark-mode inspired color matchings (dark background, bright text), but ended up deciding on using the exact color pairing that parts of the OsloMet pages use - 
                        we thought it looked quite good, and thematically fitting, with the page being a final assignment of our first semester at this university.
                        Color contrast test: color.a11y.com - No issues found. The #222 and #fed500 colors (OsloMet black and yellow) were displayed as GOOD contrast color-pairs.
                        
                        Web Accessibility tests: webaccessibility.com AND https://www.deque.com/free-accessibility-test/. Neither returned any errors.
                        For our manual testing, we tried disabling all css and made sure the resulting page made sense - it still worked perfectly. 
                        Throughout testing we tried navigating the page using only the keyboard - this also worked without issue, for both wide and narrow screen formats.
