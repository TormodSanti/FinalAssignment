                    <h2>The transition from pupil to student</h2>
                    <p class="italic">In this essay, Mirdit describes his experience in transitioning from high school to university, and the challenges it has posed.</p>
                    <p>Upper secondary high school wasn’t that hard, I watched movies while having subjects. The tests were kind of a mess, but luckily no exams because of the covid-19 situation. 
                        The best thing of having online classes was not having to get out while it wass snowing. I could also “sleep”, while attending classes. 
                        At that time, I thought university would be another chill year, but that was an easy thought, a no energy taking thinking. 
                        I wasn’t ready for what awaited me after the third year of upper secondary high school.</p>

                    <p>The beginning of university was very relaxing, but also stressing. There were extra things I had to do; pay for the semester, get the correct timetable, get the right books and finding the right classrooms. 
                        The canvas website was so confusing, I had never seen such an advanced school website like that before. Maybe I was just a new beginner (I was), but over time it got better. 
                        The hardest part was programming, I have some C# from upper secondary high school. But when I started university, I got to know that we will be programming in Java instead. 
                        I think this was the hardest part of beginning in university, so far. The other subjects were things I have done before. I also had a subject at high school called “Programming”. 
                        Here I learned to make a game using scratch the website. I’ve also made a portfolio website.</p>
                    <p>I think as a student I hold more responsibility than being a pupil. I also had to take loan, while in secondary high school I got money for attending school. 
                        I’ve also thought of dropping out many times, but I’ve dealt through it. I like attending university now, because the tasks are easier, and I started reading more books. 
                        I thought programming would be just copy’n’paste, but that was totally WRONG! Now since it’s the end of the semester, I think the exam period will be so stressing, it’s always like that. 
                        But I manage to do all the tasks alright. There aren’t so many exams, just four, but four is enough to give you tons of stress.

                    <h2>Back to the school bench after full-time employment.</h2>
                    <p class="italic">In this essay, Tormod reflects on how his university experience differs from his years in full-time employment.</p>
                    <p>After working full time for a few years, it has been a rather strange transition to go back to being a student.
                        When working a job as an employee, I had expectations and requirements tied to my performance, and I was held accountable by my employer.
                        In university, there are still things that are <em>required</em> of me, but the only one to hold myself accountable is myself. If I want to sleep late in the middle of the week, I can do so without anyone telling me I shouldn't.
                        I am allowed to, but also forced to, make that decision for myself. To quote one of my favourite childhood movies: <q cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145487/quotes?ref_=tt_ql_sm">With great power comes great responsibility</q>.
                        I have gained a lot of freedom, but I must have greater discipline in my day-to-day life, compared to working my old job.

                    <p>In returning to university, I've had the opportunity to meet many new people. Many are a fair bit younger than me, and have fairly recently graduated from high school. But it's also not too uncommon to be in the situation I find myself in - 
                        returning to finish a degree after working for a few years. Some simply want to try something new, while others have been forced to find a new direction due to the effects Covid-19 has had on their employment situation.
                        It's very refreshing to meet so many people with very different backgrounds, and I think it will enrich all of our academic lives.
