FUN
Our fun page consists of an interactive timeline that takes our GUESTS on a journey through history! Due to the scope of this assignemnt (and the complexities of the page, as we soon learned), it currently works best (if not only) on larger screens, ie laptops and desktop monitors. It will likely not function at all on touch devices, as scrolling sideways on the bottom part of the page simple doesn't work (in our experience at least, it could be different for some devices). It became a fairly large projects, with around 1600 lines of html and 600 lines of css, as well as some javascript to add interactivity to the site. We spent a lot of time working on it, and had a lot of FUN while doing it. And we hope you've had a FUN time visiting it!
There's one small piece of functionality that we have disabled for all screen widths EXCEPT 1920px. This functionality relies on counting how many pixels you have scrolled sideways and then doing some math to represent a statistic, but this statistic is highly inaccurate if your screen width is either wider or narrower than 1920px, since more or less "time" will pass per pixel scrolled depending on the screen width. Please just think of it as an added bonus for the curious, as the rest of the page is not reliant on this functionality in any way.
